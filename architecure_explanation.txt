cmd/ Directory:

Contains the entry points for different services or executables. In this case, it holds the authentication service.
cmd/auth/main.go:

This file initializes the authentication service, sets up routes, and starts the HTTP server. It loads configuration, connects to the database, and initializes the internal/auth package.
internal/ Directory:

Contains the core logic of the application. Each subdirectory corresponds to a specific domain like auth, user, post, group, etc.
internal/auth/ Directory:

Handles all authentication-related business logic, including user registration, login, password hashing, and session management.

Files:

service.go: Contains business logic for authentication.
handlers.go: Handles HTTP requests (e.g., login, register).
repository.go: Handles database operations (e.g., saving users, retrieving user data).
models.go: Contains data models related to authentication (e.g., User, Session).
Other Subdirectories in internal/:

Each directory (user, post, group, chat, notification) has similar structure:
service.go: Core business logic for the module.
handlers.go: HTTP handlers.
repository.go: Database operations.
models.go: Data models for the module.
internal/middleware/ Directory:

Contains reusable middleware functions.
Files:

auth_middleware.go: Ensures routes are accessed only by authenticated users.
session_middleware.go: Handles session validation and management.
internal/db/ Directory:

Handles database connectivity and migrations.
Files:

migrations/: Contains SQL migration files to set up or modify the database schema.
Example: 000001_create_users_table.up.sql and .down.sql handle creating and rolling back the users table.
sqlite/: Contains the SQLite-specific connection logic in sqlite.go.
pkg/ Directory:

Contains reusable utilities and third-party packages used across the project.
Subdirectories:

websocket/: Handles WebSocket logic for real-time chat.
hub.go: Manages connected clients and broadcasting messages.
client.go: Handles each WebSocket client.
utils/: Contains helper functions.
hash.go: Handles password hashing with bcrypt.
validator.go: Validates inputs like email formats, password strength, etc.
config/: Loads and manages environment variables.
config.go: Loads and parses .env file.
frontend/ Directory:

Contains the frontend code, typically React, Vue.js, or Next.js.
Includes the Dockerfile for building the frontend container.
Project Root:

docker-compose.yml: Manages multi-container deployment for both frontend and backend services.
Dockerfile: Contains Docker configuration for the backend service.
.env: Stores environment variables for configurations like database connections.
